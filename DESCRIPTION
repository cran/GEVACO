Description: A novel statistical model to detect the joint genetic and dynamic gene-environment (GxE) interaction with continuous traits in genetic association studies. It uses varying-coefficient models to account for different GxE trajectories, regardless whether the relationship is linear or not. The package includes one function, GxEtest(), to test a single genetic variant (e.g., a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP), and another function, GxEscreen(), to test for a set of genetic variants. The method involves a likelihood ratio test described in Crainiceanu, C. M., and Ruppert, D. (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2004.00438.x>.
